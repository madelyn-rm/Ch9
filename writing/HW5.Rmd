```{r setup, include=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load in the data:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
homicides <- read.csv('/Users/madelynmaclaughlin/Downloads/R_class/Ch_9/data/homicides.csv')
head(homicides)
```

I am creating the graph from choice 2. Let's try and reduce the data to what we need and organize it.
```{r}
homicides %>% 
  select(reported_date, city) %>% 
  filter(city == "Baltimore") %>% 
  mutate(reported_date = ymd(reported_date)) %>% 
  arrange(reported_date)
```
